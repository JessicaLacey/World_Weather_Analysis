## Provide vacation destinations

### Analysis
Using the temperature parameters given by the client, I created a Travel Destinations Map.

From there I created a vacation itinerary to include markers for information on each destination.

### Results
Recommended four vacation destinations in Africa that fit within the client's temperature parameters and are in driving distance from each other.
